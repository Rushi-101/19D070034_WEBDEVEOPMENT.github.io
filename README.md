<p>A famous quote is that <b><i>"Great ambition is the passion of a great character."</i></b><br>
Working as an electrical engineer can allow me to make life easier for others and allow me to impact society in a positive way.<br>
Also I participated in <b>ITSP</b> where me and my team had made a device and an app that provides information of any victim who
has met with an accident, and thus provide medical help to the victim as soon as possible.<br>
Thus my ambitions in life are to make other's life more easy and become a role model for the society.</p>
